**REPOSITORY FOR NON-LINEAR TOPOLOGICAL PUMPING**

This research work was carried out at RPTU - Kaiserslautern, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Michael Fleischhauer. 

The aim was to study the non-linear topological pumping in Rice-Mele type models, by considering non-linear Kerr solitons as the disperssion solutions in the quantum-many-body approach.
Band structure, instantaneous and unitary time-evolution was analyzed, developing a well-funded theoretical and numerical framework to fully compute Zak Phases, Chern Number, and
the Center Of Mass (C.O.M.).

- The "QCA_Abstract.pdf" file is an abstract that was submitted to the "Quantum Campus Aarhus Annual Meeting 2025" at Aarhus University, including the main findings and potential extensions to the work.
- The "QCA_Poster_Chern_Quantum_Transport.pdf" files in the poster that it was presented in the "Quantum Campus Aarhus Annual Meeting 2025" at Aarhus University. This poster shows
  the basic foundationals of the model, the methodolgy, and main results, showing the C.O.M. evolution of the soliton solutions in the lattice, as well as the mapping of the Chern
  transport depending on the interaction strenght and the driven pumping frequency, characterizing the adiabatic region in the parameter space where there is a non-trivial transport.
- The "Results" folder includes all the plots of the analysis of the model. It was simulated the band structure, energy evolution, time evolution of the soliton solutions, Zak phases, Chern numbers, and the C.O.M. evolution. The parameter space is composed by the driven frequency and on-site potential, in the adiabatic evolution. Dependence with the interaction strenght is fully studied.
